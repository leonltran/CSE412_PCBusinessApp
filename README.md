## Overview

This project entails the development of a Windows application and a PostgreSQL database designed to cater to the needs of a custom PC building retailer. The primary focus is on efficient order management, allowing users to seamlessly handle customer orders, track builds, and manage deliveries.

## Features

- **Database Structure:** The PostgreSQL database is designed to store essential tables containing information about parts, customer orders, computer builds, and customer details.

- **Order Management:** The application is geared towards facilitating order management.
  
- **Build Information:** Individual PC builds are represented as objects with unique identifiers and a list of associated parts. This structure enables the production of customized PCs based on user preferences.

- **User Interaction:** Users can utilize the application to access detailed information about PC builds and orders. The information provided by the computer object assists in building PCs, while the order object allows users to group builds, track their progress, and manage deliveries.
